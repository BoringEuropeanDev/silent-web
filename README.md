## What's Different About Silent Web?

Most ad blockers:
- ❌ Cost money or have limited features
- ❌ Slow down your computer
- ❌ Show you ads themselves (hypocritical)

Silent Web:
- ✅ Completely FREE
- ✅ Super lightweight (2-4 MB)
- ✅ No annoying popup ads
- ✅ Simple 3-button interface
- ✅ Works better than "free" alternatives

## Common Questions

**Q: Will it slow down my computer?**
A: No. It uses almost no memory or processing power. Your computer will be the same or faster (because ads take forever to load).

**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Yes. It doesn't collect your data, track you, or spy on you. Everything happens locally on your computer.

**Q: Does it work on YouTube?**
A: Partially. YouTube has special anti-blocking protection. Most ads get removed, but YouTube sometimes gets around it. This is a YouTube limitation, not a Silent Web problem.

**Q: What if it breaks a website?**
A: Refresh the page or temporarily disable the extension. Very rare though. Most websites work perfectly.

**Q: Will websites know I'm blocking ads?**
A: Some might, but they can't force you to see ads. The choice is yours.

**Q: Can I turn it off?**
A: Yes. Go back to `chrome://extensions/`, find Silent Web, and click the toggle to OFF.

**Q: My settings aren't saving?**
A: Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) and reload. If that doesn't work, remove the extension and reinstall.

**Q: What's the difference between the two buttons?**
A: 
- **BLOCK ALL ADS** = Remove ads from everywhere (ads blocker mode)
- **BLOCK 18+ SITES** = Don't let you access adult/gambling sites (parental control mode)

You can only use one at a time. The extension asks which one you want.
